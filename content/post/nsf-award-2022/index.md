Our project _**Revising Models of the Glacier-ocean Boundary Layer with Novel Laboratory Experiments**_ has been recently awarded a 4-year research grant from [NSF Office of Polar Programs (OPP)](https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OPP). This is a collaboration with [Dr. Alexander Robel](https://eas.gatech.edu/people/robel-dr-alexander) from the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. We are excited!
