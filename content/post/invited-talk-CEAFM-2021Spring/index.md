In this talk, I will present a three-camera reconstruction method to obtain time-resolved, 3D fluid velocity and density data
from planar data. The efficacy of the method has been validated using a DNS dataset of turbulent channel flow. It is then applied to a combined stereo-PIV and PLIF dataset to reconstruct the turbulent structures inside a turbulent SF6 jet discharged into a coflowing air stream. In the second part, I will discuss the similarities and differences on the interscale
kinetic energy transfer in particle-laden and bubble-laden plumes/flows. Here is the announcement on the CEAFM website: [https://pages.jh.edu/ceafm/weekly-seminar/Spring21/Lai.html](https://pages.jh.edu/ceafm/weekly-seminar/Spring21/Lai.html).
