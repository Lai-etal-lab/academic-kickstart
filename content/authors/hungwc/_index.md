Wei-Cheng Hung is pursuing his PhD degree in Georgia Institute of Technology. He has Professional engineer license of hydraulic engineering and 3-year consultant engineer experience in Taiwan. He focuses on open channel hydraulic model, flooding model and hydrological analysis for structure design.

Now, he is a member of Et al. Lab research group and interests in public safety of drinking water system. His research aims to pipe system with water hammer and contamination issues in order to improve old water supplying system in city. He combines experimental results with numerical model to predict and determine what and where are the best options to improve water supplying system. The experiment method uses PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technology to observe turbulent flow and shock wave dynamics of mechanism in pipe system.
