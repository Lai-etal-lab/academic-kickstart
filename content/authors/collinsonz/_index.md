Zephren Collinson is currently an Environmental Engineering grad student at Georgia Tech (GT), and graduated from the GT EnvE undergraduate program in May 2020. During undergrad he participated in hydraulics research with Dr. Hermann Fritz and worked as an EHS intern at a 
medical manufacturing plant in Northeast Georgia. This Summer he is also working part time as an intern at Gresham Smith, primarily on pump selection and other sewage system hydraulics.

Over the spring and summer semesters in 2021, he has mainly worked with Dr. Lai and PhD student Muhammad to update the small tilting flume and devise new methods to improve the measurement accuracy of the Nortek Vectrino ADV Profiler. Some additional projects he has helped with were a comparison of particle image velocimetry (PIV) and scalar image velocimetry (SIV) software, creating a fractal grid for studies on enhancing turbulent mixing, and assisting Muhammad with his glacial ice melt project. He hopes to continue working on ADV measurements and upgrades to the Big Tilting Flume this coming Fall (2021).

In his spare time, Zephren is the captain of the GT Ultimate Frisbee team, plays Sousaphone in the GT pep band, homebrews mead, and plays a ton of Dungeons and Dragons. He also tries to do sprint triathlons... slowly...
