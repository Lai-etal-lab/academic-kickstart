Alexander Michael Zimmer is from Marietta, Georgia and is currently pursuing his Civil Engineering Bachelor’s degree from Georgia Tech. He plans to concentrate in Environmental and Water Systems.

Currently he is a recipient of the President’s Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) assisting the research of Muhammad, a current Ph.D. student under the supervision of Dr. Lai. In Spring 2021 his assisted in the construction of a controlled laboratory facility that generates
homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT) using Random Actuated Synthetic Jet Arrays with enhancement using fractal-shaped jet nozzles. With the use of this facility in fall 2021, he will research how ambient turbulence, salinity, and temperature affect the melt rate of ice in marine-terminating glaciers found in Antarctica and Greenland.
